# IBM Cloud Code Engine Terraform template

## Purpose

Main idea is to provide a very simple Terraform boilerplate for [IBM Cloud Code Engine](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine). This can be used as a starting point and extended.
Prerequisite to use this template is a recent version of the [IBM-Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest), ideally `>=v1.55.0`.
